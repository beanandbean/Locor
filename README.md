Locor
=====

LOCOR is a flat iOS password manage app.
We think a person only needs a limited number of passwords for he can use a same password in some different places. For example, use a some strong password for Apple Id, main E-mail and Github. And LOCOR is an app using this idea to create a new concept about password storage.

However, the LOCOR project has been closed now for we have started working on its replacement, a better designed app, [PassPalette](http://github.com/beanandbean/PassPalette). Some parts of LOCOR code will be gradually adopted by the new app.
